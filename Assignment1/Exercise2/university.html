                    <h3>Distributed Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        During spring of 2020, I had the pleasure of having to work on a very interesting and complex assignment 
                        while the COVID-19 pandemic was just starting. The assignment was about developing a music streaming on demand app
                        using Java and Android.
                    </p>    
                    <p>
                        The first part was about designing and developing the music streaming Framework(Event Delivering System)
                        that would be responsible for supporting the on demand stream or download of the music library that was provided and consisted of 3 main components:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Publisher Node: Responsible for saving, searching and exporting the music</li>
                        <li>Broker Nodes: Balancing the load from the user requests</li>
                        <li>Consumer Node: Responsible for accepting user requests, could be either online or offline</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The second part was about the creation of an Android app that utilized our framework in a way that the music could be
                        played from the customers phone. The Home Screen of the app included a list of all the available artists, albums and songs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The consumer node will notify the Broker nodes of the user request and after receiving a positive response the media player
                        will open and play the song the user requested.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>
                        Although a field of CS that involves a lot of math, I was glad I gave it a try because I saw considerable progress
                        in my programming skills because of the two assignments I worked on throughout the semester.
                    </p>
                    <h4>A*</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the first assignment we were asked to develop a program in Java or Python that would find the optimal solution to the Bridge and Torch problem.
                        This problem is about a family trying to cross a bridge that can hold up to 2 people, the torch has limited time and the algorithm must find the
                        best combination of people to cross without the torch going out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The A* algorithm manages that by calculating the sum of the real crossing time and a heuristic function of the couple
                        trying to pass to the opposite side of the bridge, the sum is inserted in a priority queue and when every possible combinations sum is calculated
                        it chooses the couple with the lowest sum as the next step. Then it repeats until everyone has crossed over. This path is now considered final and optimal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier</h4>
                    <p>
                        For the second assignment we were given a public dataset called «Large Movie Review Dataset» that contains movie reviews and were asked to develop a text classification
                        program in Java, C++ or Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each review was categorized as positive if its score was &lt;6 or negative if its score was &gt;4, we had to use this dataset to train the algorithm
                        so it can accurately classify a review as positive or negative based only on what the user wrote.
                    </p>

                        I have been postponing this course for a while because I couldn't grasp the concept of pointers at a level where I was confident of
                        using them regularly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thankfully this year the project was about using the API of an engine to create a game of our choice, a fascinating subject for someone
                        who wants to try their luck in Game Development. It certainly sparked my interest and motivated me to work on a daily basis. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The assignment was about creating an arcade game using the SGG library that was created for this purpose, the use of dynamic memory, inheritance,
                        polymorphism and collection was obligatory and good planning and code structured would be taken into consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My team consisted of me and another colleague, we decided to work on a simple game called Pong on which we added a Main Menu, Statistics and
                        Player History screens in order to add more complexity and submit a game that we felt was complete.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        One certain feature that proved challenging was the collision of the ball with the players and the walls. The collision with the players required some
                        math in order to calculate the trajectory of the ball, since hitting the middle of the player should simply send back the ball. Hitting the top or bottom required
                        should send the ball back at a different angle.
