                    <p>Even though I wasn't knowledgeable about the process of creating and maintaining a website, there was need for someone
                        to write some articles and add some elements on the website, so I was asked to start learing about Joomla and the process
                        of simple maintenance on websites created with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>After a short while I became comfortable working with Joomla since it required minimum coding experience and took upon myself
                        the job of designing and maintening. As a self-learner even basic tasks took a long time to complete since I had to be sure everything worked
                        perfectly.

                    <h3 id="js">Javascript</h3>
                    <p>In preparation of 2021 eastern semester, I knew Web Development would be one of courses I would be working and that JavaScript would be heavily involved, 
                        so while going through a couple of JS web courses I stumbled upon a video called "Developing a Discord Bot with JS".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discord is a chat app, similar to programs such as Skype or TeamSpeak, or professional communications platforms like Slack.
                    </p>
                    <p>It supports video calls, voice chat, and text, allowing users to get in touch however they please. It's a platform that I have been using daily since 2016
                        and has been a way to keep in touch with friends and colleagues during the pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have been part of a Discord Server that frequently does "movie-nights" where members throughout the week post IMDB link's of a movie, moderators gather all the links
                        and put up a voting system where users "react" using emojis to submit their vote. I thought a bot that would automate this procedure would be good introduction
                        to JS and would be fairly quick to do.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started by getting familiar with a few JS terms and then moved on setting up Visual Studio Code, NodeJS and the Discord API called DiscordJS, the whole project
                        was finished in about 10 days and consisted of the following functions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Invite links sent to the user through a private message</li>
                        <li>Handling movie submissions that would be put on vote at the end of week</li>
                        <li>When grades are published about a course the user is interested in, sent a private message to notify him</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 id="ahk">AutoHotKey</h3>
                    <p>I need to state that I was never a fan of work and assignments that required the typing of thousands of words, and a big part of that dissatisfaction
                        was the need of intonation which I never used in personal online conversations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>So I thought, why can't I make a simple script that will take a word like "καλημερα" and automatically turns it into "καλημέρα".
                    </p>
                    <p>And so I did using a free open-source scripting language called AutoHotKey, I combined a simple script with a database I made of over 300.000 words.
                    </p>
                    <p>The database contained the word with and without its intonation, and the script kept track of what typed until I pressed &lt;space&gt;, if the word existed
                        in my database, it would replace it with the one with the right intonation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have been using it on my personal computer on daily basis and has proved really useful especially when writing text-based assignments
                        or reports.
                    </p>
